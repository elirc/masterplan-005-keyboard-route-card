# Verification record

[Overview](../README.md) · [Machine-readable evidence](verification.json)

Local reference checks ran on 2026-10-03 with **Node v22.16.0**. The machine-readable record contains the captured output rather than an invented transcript.

## Executable checks

Command: `node tools/check-site.mjs`. Exit code: **0**. Local asset references passed existence checks; this is not a behavioral unit-test suite.

Re-run from this repository with `npm test`. There are no external npm dependencies. The local preview can be started with npm start.

## Browser evidence

- No document horizontal overflow at 1200, 800, 500 and 320 CSS pixels
- First Tab exposes skip link; Enter transfers focus to main
- Tab route and reverse Tab verified; descriptive contact link reachable
- Large-text probe remains within viewport (not a full assistive-technology audit)

These checks ran in installed Microsoft Edge through a browser automation harness. No JavaScript page errors were observed. A representative screenshot is saved in images/preview.png. The harness was run from the parent workspace; the reproduction checklist below can be performed without installing that harness.

## Reproduce the important observation yourself

Reload, use Tab, Enter and Shift+Tab without the mouse, and record activeElement. Increase text size and inspect every focus indicator. Do not claim a full accessibility certification.

Record viewport, input, expected result and actual result. For interaction failures, verify that correcting the input produces a normal result and does not leave stale error styling or stale output. For a layout failure, distinguish document overflow from an intentionally scrollable table region.

## Limits

These observations cover the listed fixtures and one installed browser. They are not a full cross-browser, accessibility, production-security or performance audit. There is no real external service to validate. Static pages use a lightweight link check in CI; the manual/browser observations remain essential. New stories require new evidence after your changes.

The GitHub Actions workflow runs `npm test` on push and pull request. Its configuration is included; an actual remote success must be verified on GitHub separately. Do not infer it merely from this local report.
