# M005: architecture decision laboratory

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

Architecture at this scale means assigning responsibilities and avoiding unnecessary synchronization. You do not need a distributed system diagram to make a consequential design choice. A small function boundary, a stable identifier or one CSS owner can determine whether a later change stays understandable.

## Decision review 1: Use native anchors

**Reference rationale:** A link already supports keyboard activation, browser navigation and a meaningful accessible role. Clickable generic divs would require recreating behavior that HTML provides.

**Question to resolve:** Explain the difference between navigating somewhere and performing an action.

### Write competing proposals

Proposal A is the reference approach. Proposal B must be a plausible alternative, not an obviously broken straw man. Describe what each stores, what each derives, which boundary each validates and where visible feedback occurs. For a static page, describe source order, container/child ownership and content behavior instead of inventing application state.

### Use the same acceptance examples

Run both proposals against the same ordinary case, boundary and future-change scenario. If they produce different behavior, decide whether the difference is permitted by the contract. If both satisfy the contract, compare the number of facts a maintainer must keep synchronized and the amount of unrelated work needed for the next feature.

| Criterion | Reference proposal | Alternative proposal | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meets current user contract | Fill in | Fill in | One discriminating example |
| Owns each fact in one place | Fill in | Fill in | Source or state diagram |
| Handles failure or missing input | Fill in | Fill in | Error/recovery sequence |
| Supports the next small story | Fill in | Fill in | Proposed bounded diff |

### Record the decision with a reversal condition

Write: “I choose A/B because this concrete example shows this cost. I would revisit the choice if this specific requirement appeared.” A reversal condition prevents the decision from becoming a slogan. Do not use a hypothetical million-user future to justify complexity that teaches nothing about the present example.

**Source anchor:** `public/index.html` and `public/index.html and public/style.css`. Inspect the actual dependency direction; a diagram that names layers but cannot identify a call or data flow is incomplete.

## Decision review 2: Avoid positive tabindex values

**Reference rationale:** Source order describes the intended reading and focus sequence. Positive tabindex can create a second order that becomes difficult to maintain as links are added.

**Question to resolve:** Predict the sequence after inserting a new link in the source.

## Decision review 3: Make focus visible and understandable

**Reference rationale:** The focus outline shows where the next keyboard action will occur. Descriptive link text explains the destination independently of surrounding prose. These are separate requirements.

**Question to resolve:** Explain why a visible outline does not rescue a link labeled only “here”.

## A compact decision record you can copy

```text
Context and user need:
Current invariant:
Proposal A:
Proposal B:
Discriminating example:
Observed or predicted outcomes, clearly labeled:
Decision and reason:
Cost accepted:
Revisit when:
Verification still needed:
```

## Avoid accidental scope expansion

A new abstraction should answer a problem you can name in the current code or selected story. If the main benefit is that it looks more professional, ask what specific change becomes easier and what new concepts a junior now has to learn. Keep the reference small enough to trace.

## Transfer the review habit

Can someone predict what each focused link will do without using a mouse?

Use that question to compare this project with its paired curriculum repository. Cite the actual source or guide you inspected; do not claim the other repository uses a pattern merely because its name sounds related. Your comparison may conclude that the shared learning concept appears in a different implementation.
